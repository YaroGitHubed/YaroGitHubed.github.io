<p style="text-align: justify; width: 600px; margin: auto">I am a scientist with a PhD degree in biotechnology. I have been in science for over ten years working at different universities in the UK.
Recently I found out about your course. There are several reasons why I am applying for a place on this course. I have always had a keen desire to learn programming but science is demanding and it was problematic to focus on coding properly. Now I do have spare time. Another reason is that I want to move into a different area of biology dealing with bioinformatics, data analysis and data presentation. Obviously, this requires a knowledge of programming languages, including ones used in web development. Also, I think this course is very good investment of time. It definitely outcompetes other coding boot camps providing better quality of education.
